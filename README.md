- 👋 Hi, I’m Toby. 
- 👀 I’m interested in addressing ecological questions through programming. Specifically relating to datasets from acoustic monitoring of bat activity, and radio-telemetry at the moment. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and always trying to improve my R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects invovling bat acoustic data processing and analyses, and radio telemetry data. 
- 📫 Reach me via my web page: tobythorne.com/contact_me/
